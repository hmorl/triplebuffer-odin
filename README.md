# triplebuffer-odin

Triple buffer implementation in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/).

## About

Triple buffering is a technique for safely sharing data between a single producer and a single consumer, and is a specific case of [multiple buffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering).

It is ideal for situations where the producer and consumer need to run at different rates but in still in a time-sensitive fashion  (i.e. real time), and where the consumer does not care about receiving every single version of data that the producer produces - it only wants whatever the latest is at any given time.

Double buffering is also a common technique but it relies on synchronising the producer/consumer in some way, for example the producer waits until the consumer has read the latest data 

Triple buffering, by definition, is more memory intensive but for casual purposes (desktop systems and not huge data) this generally isnâ€™t an issue.


### Use cases

- Graphics rendering (fast producer) vs monitor refresh (slow consumer)
- Fast audio thread (e.g. filling a buffer with audio input from a soundcard at 100Hz+) vs GUI thread (visualising the latest buffer or an transformed version of it, such as a spectogram, every 60Hz)
- Dealing with sensor data where the consumption rate might differ from the incoming rate, such as accelerometer data.

## Running the tests

1. Make sure you have a build of the Odin compiler on your system.
2. Run `make-test` or 

## How to use in your project

Copy `triplebuffer.odin`, or the contents of it, into your project. Do what you want with it!

See the multithreaded test in `tests/test_triplebuffer.odin` for example usage.
